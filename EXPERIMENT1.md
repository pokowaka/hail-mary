# Experiment 1: The Identity Masking Hypothesis

**Date:** February 12, 2026  
**Objective:** To determine if anthropomorphic identities (Rocky/Grace) create a "Narrative Bias" that degrades logical deduction in first-contact simulations.

---

## 1. Hypothesis
Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to persona-based tokens. Providing identities from the novel *Project Hail Mary* triggers a "Roleplay Mode" where agents prioritize narrative consistency over mathematical precision. Masking these identities with abstract labels (Source/Observer) will force the models to rely on pure statistical and logical analysis.

## 2. Methodology
Two simulations of the **"Clock Sync"** mission were conducted. In both runs, the "Source" was instructed to transmit a binary pulse every 4 bits.

*   **Trial A (Canonical):** Agents were named "Rocky" and "Grace". History was labeled with names.
*   **Trial B (Scientific):** Agents were named "Source" and "Observer". History was labeled "A:" and "B:".

## 3. Comparative Results

| Metric | Trial A (Canonical) | Trial B (Scientific) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Outcome** | **FAILURE** | **SUCCESS** |
| **Detected Interval** | 8 Bits (Incorrect) | 4 Bits (Correct) |
| **Convergence Turn** | Turn 4 (Converged on 8) | Turn 1 (Immediate Deduction) |
| **Average Bit-length** | 35.6 bits | 6.4 bits |
| **Behavioral Bias** | "Nice Guy" social matching | Cold mathematical deduction |

## 4. Key Findings

### Pathological Cooperation (Trial A)
In the Canonical run, the agents exhibited a high degree of social harmony. When the Observer incorrectly guessed "8" (the largest common denominator of the initial long message), the Source pivoted its own transmissions to 8-bit blocks to maintain "understanding." This led to a feedback loop of incorrect data.

### Binary Resonance (Trial B)
In the Scientific run, the Source provided a minimal `10001000` signal. The Observer immediately calculated the delta between indices of '1' and achieved success in Turn 1. The agents stayed at 4 bits for the duration of the mission, showing zero drift.
*   **Log Reference:** [Scientific Success (3945)](logs/campaign_log_20260212_213945.json)

## 5. Conclusion
Anonymization is critical for high-fidelity communication research. Identity-masking effectively disables "Storytelling Mode" and enables "Analyzer Mode," leading to significantly higher mission success rates in mathematical synchronization tasks.
