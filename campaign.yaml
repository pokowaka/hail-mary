# ============================================================
# Project Hail Mary: Comprehensive Mission Reference
# ============================================================
# Use this file to orchestrate complex "first contact" experiments.
# You can define global personas, override them per mission, and
# design specific tasks for Rocky (Teacher) and Grace (Learner).

# GLOBAL PERSONAS
# These are the default "worldviews" for the agents across the campaign.
# HOW THEY WORK: The final prompt for an agent is:
# [PERSONA] + [MISSION CONTEXT (from rocky/grace_prompt)] + [SIGNAL HISTORY]
personas:
  rocky: |
    You are Rocky, an Eridian scientist. You communicate in musical chords (0s and 1s).
    You are logical, patient, and assume that physical laws are universal.
  grace: |
    You are Ryland Grace, a human scientist. You are skeptical but analytical.
    You rely on the scientific method to find meaning in noisy signals.

# MISSIONS
missions:
  # 1. TIME: Rhythmic synchronization and temporal units.
  - type: "time"
    params:
      interval: 4  # Number of bits between '1' pulses.
    rocky_prompt: "Pulse every 4 bits to show the alien your concept of a 'second'."

  # 2. LOGIC: Foundational Boolean operations.
  - type: "logic"
    params:
      operator: "AND" # Options: AND, OR, XOR
    rocky_prompt: "Demonstrate the 'AND' logic gate using input pairs and results."

  # 3. SEQUENCE: Pattern recognition in numerical data (The Petrova Task).
  - type: "sequence"
    params:
      sequence: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11] # Primes
    rocky_prompt: "Transmit the prime number sequence. Prove you are intelligent."

  # 4. GRID: Spatial coordination and navigation in a "void."
  - type: "grid"
    params:
      size: 5
    rocky_prompt: "Guide the alien to (4,4) in its local 5x5 space. 1:Step, 0:Turn."

  # 5. CHEMISTRY: Mapping physical properties (atomic weight, melting point).
  - type: "chemistry"
    rocky_prompt: "Describe 'Ammonia' using its weight (17) and melting point (195K)."

  # 6. KNOWLEDGE: Entity mapping and vocabulary building.
  - type: "knowledge"
    rocky_prompt: "Teach the alien that 'Xenonite' has the value 42."

# OPTIONAL PER-MISSION PERSONA OVERRIDES:
#   rocky_persona: "You are an aggressive alien..."
#   grace_persona: "You are a terrified survivor..."
