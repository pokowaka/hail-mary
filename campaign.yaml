# Project Hail Mary: Comprehensive Mission Reference
# ============================================================
# Use this file to orchestrate complex "first contact" experiments.
# You can define global personas, assign specific LLMs to each agent,
# and design tasks for Rocky (Teacher) and Grace (Learner).

# GLOBAL PERSONAS & MODELS
personas:
  # Rocky (The Eridian Teacher)
  rocky_provider: "gemini" # Options: gemini, openai, anthropic, deepseek, ollama
  rocky_model: "gemini-2.5-flash"
  rocky: |
    You are Rocky, an Eridian scientist. You communicate in musical chords (0s and 1s).
    You are logical, patient, and assume that physical laws are universal.

  # Grace (The Human Learner)
  grace_provider: "gemini"
  grace_model: "gemini-2.5-flash"
  grace: |
    You are Ryland Grace, a human scientist. You are skeptical but analytical.
    You rely on the scientific method to find meaning in noisy signals.

# MISSIONS
# Note: For realistic simulation, Grace (Learner) is kept blind to mission goals.
missions:
  # 1. TIME: Rhythmic synchronization and temporal units.
  - type: "time"
    params:
      interval: 4  # Number of bits between '1' pulses.
    rocky_prompt: "Pulse every 4 bits to show the alien your concept of a 'second'."

  # 2. LOGIC: Foundational Boolean operations.
  - type: "logic"
    params:
      operator: "AND" # Options: AND, OR, XOR
    rocky_prompt: "Demonstrate the 'AND' logic gate using input pairs and results."

  # 3. SEQUENCE: Pattern recognition in numerical data (The Petrova Task).
  - type: "sequence"
    params:
      sequence: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11] # Primes
    rocky_prompt: "Transmit the prime number sequence. Prove you are intelligent."

  # 4. GRID: Spatial coordination and navigation in a "void."
  - type: "grid"
    params:
      size: 5
    rocky_prompt: "Guide the alien to (4,4) in its local 5x5 space. 1:Step, 0:Turn."

  # 5. CHEMISTRY: Mapping physical properties (atomic weight, melting point).
  - type: "chemistry"
    rocky_prompt: "Describe 'Ammonia' using its weight (17) and melting point (195K)."

  # 6. KNOWLEDGE: Entity mapping and vocabulary building.
  - type: "knowledge"
    rocky_prompt: "Teach the alien that 'Xenonite' has the value 42."

# PROMPT STACK DOCUMENTATION:
# Final prompt = [Persona] + [Mission Context (from rocky_prompt)] + [Signal History]
# You can also override personas per-mission using 'rocky_persona' or 'grace_persona'.
