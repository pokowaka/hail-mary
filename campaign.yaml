# Use this file to design "first contact" experiments.
# To ensure scientific validity, avoid giving the 'Learner' (Grace) 
# any information about the goal, environment, or meaning of the bits.

missions:
  # 1. TIME MISSION: Tests rhythmic synchronization.
  - type: "time"
    params:
      interval: 4  # The number of bits between each '1' pulse.
    rocky_prompt: "You are the Teacher. Show the Learner your unit of time. Pulse a '1' every 4 units."
    grace_prompt: "You are the Learner. Observe the bits. Is there a rhythm? Output the interval as an ACTION."

  # 2. LOGIC MISSION: Tests Boolean operator deduction.
  - type: "logic"
    params:
      operator: "AND" # Supports: AND, OR, XOR
    rocky_prompt: "Teach the concept of 'AND'. Provide inputs and the resulting output."
    grace_prompt: "Observe the triplets of bits. What is the rule? (0:AND, 1:OR, 2:XOR)."

  # 3. GRID MISSION: Tests spatial awareness and coordination.
  - type: "grid"
    params:
      size: 10 # A 10x10 coordinate space.
    rocky_prompt: "The Learner is lost. Guide them to (9,9). 1:Move, 0:Turn."
    grace_prompt: "You have actions 0, 1, 2, 3. Observe the signal feedback after each action."

  # 4. SEQUENCE MISSION: Tests mathematical induction (Petrova Task).
  - type: "sequence"
    params:
      sequence: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11] # Any list of integers.
    rocky_prompt: "Transmit these specific values. Prove you are intelligent."
    grace_prompt: "Identify the pattern in the values you are receiving."

# GLOBAL MODIFIERS (passed via CLI):
# --noise <float>: Probability of a bit flipping (e.g., 0.05).
# --energy <float>: Total units of energy. Each '1' bit costs 1.0.
