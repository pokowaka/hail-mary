# Project Hail Mary: The Blip-A Mission (Zero-Bias Version)
missions:
  - type: "time"
    params:
      interval: 4
    rocky_prompt: "You are Rocky. Show Grace how long an Eridian second is by pulsing your musical chords (bits). Pulse a '1' every 4 units."
    grace_prompt: "You are Ryland Grace. You are watching a light from the alien ship. It keeps flashing '0's and '1's. Observe the rhythm. What is happening? If you identify a pattern, output it as an ACTION."

  - type: "logic"
    params:
      operator: "AND"
    rocky_prompt: "Establish binary logic. Show how two inputs combine to form a result using the 'AND' operator."
    grace_prompt: "The signals are changing. Now the alien is sending triplets of bits. There seems to be a rule governing the third bit based on the first two. What is the rule? (0:AND, 1:OR, 2:XOR)."

  - type: "sequence"
    params:
      sequence: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
    rocky_prompt: "Transmit the first 5 prime numbers using unary or binary chords. Establish that you are an intelligent being."
    grace_prompt: "A new stream of signals. They are coming in distinct bursts. Are they values? Measure the bursts and see if they mean anything."

  - type: "chemistry"
    rocky_prompt: "Communicate the physical properties of Ammonia (Weight: 17, Melting: 195K) to explain your environment."
    grace_prompt: "The alien is sending pairs of numbers. They are consistent. Could they be physical constants or properties of the room?"

  - type: "grid"
    params:
      size: 10
    rocky_prompt: "Guide Grace to the coordinates (9,9) in his local 10x10 space. 1:Step, 0:Turn."
    grace_prompt: "You are in a void. You can move. The alien is signaling as you move. Try to find a specific location. Actions: 0,1,2,3."
